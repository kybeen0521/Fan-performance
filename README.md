# Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) Performance Evaluation in Fluid Machinery

---

## 🌀 Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing the performance variation of a centrifugal fan
by adjusting the Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) angle during experiments.

The project focuses on understanding how IGV angle affects fan efficiency,
total pressure rise, and air flow characteristics through data-driven analysis.

The workflow allows calculation of efficiency curves and visualization of fan performance
based on experimental data collected at different vane angles.

🧮 Experimental Background

In fluid machinery laboratories, performance tests are conducted by adjusting the inlet guide vane (IGV)
to control the flow direction and air volume entering the impeller.
This directly influences the static pressure, dynamic pressure, and overall fan efficiency.

During each test:

The guide vane angle is changed incrementally (e.g., 19°)

Measurements are taken for:

Air volume (m³/min)

Total pressure (mmAq)

Shaft power (kW)

The fan efficiency is then computed using:

𝜂=((𝑄×Δ𝑃total)/Pshaft)x100

where
Q = air flow rate (m³/s)
Δ𝑃𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = total pressure rise (Pa)
Pshaft = shaft power input (W)
